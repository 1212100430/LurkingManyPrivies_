                Welcome to Lurking Many Privies (LMP), your Learner-Made, Privacy-focused guide to the best (and worst!) washrooms on campus!
            </p>

                Tired of the mystery that comes with picking a privy? Our website is designed to provide clear, honest rankings and even myths of every ladies' room in the school, helping you navigate your day with confidence. At LMP, we aim to build a simple, practical community resource for students who just want clear information about the washrooms on campus. Every review and small detail — whether a restroom is clean, quiet, crowded, low on supplies, or undergoing maintenance — helps others plan their day more smoothly. Maybe you’ve found a consistently tidy spot near the library, or noticed a washroom that’s often busy between classes; sharing these observations makes campus life easier for everyone. LMP is here to offer clarity and convenience, so you can choose a restroom with confidence and focus on what actually matters during your day.
