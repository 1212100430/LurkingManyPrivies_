                <h2>1. The Science Lab's Toilet</h2>
        
                <p>Overview<br>
                Located in the lab unit next to the Secondary library.<br>
                Recently reopened after the lab had been closed for a long period.
                </p>
        
                <p>Pros:</p>
                <ul class="pros-list">
                    <li>Very clean due to low usage</li>
                    <li>Easy to pee/poop because it’s never crowded</li>
                    <li>Two stalls, same as most other toilets</li>
                    <li>No noticeable smell (neither fragrant nor bad)</li>
                    <li>Always well-stocked with tissues and hand soap</li>
                </ul>
        
                <p>Cons:</p>
                <ul class="cons-list">
                    <li>The unit is quiet and not very populated</li>
                    <li>No one opens the door during lunchtime, so access can be impossible</li>
                    <li>Slightly eerie atmosphere (at least for me) because this toilet is cold.</li>
                </ul>

        </div>
        <p>The toilet is surprisingly clean, mostly because almost no one uses it. With two stalls and a reliable supply of tissues and hand soap, it’s comfortable for both quick stops and longer visits, and there’s no noticeable smell at all. The downside is that the whole unit is pretty empty, and during lunchtime the door is often locked with nobody around to open it. The atmosphere can also feel a bit eerie when it gets too quiet. Still, if you’re the type of person who would skip some crazy experiment just to come and try out a new toilet yourself, this one is definitely worth the detour.</p>

                <h2>2. The Primary Library's Toilet</h2>
        
                <p>Overview<br>
                Haven’t really used it until this year<br>
                Located inside the primary library
                </p>
        
                <p>Pros:</p>
                <ul class="pros-list">
                    <li>It’s basically a gamble: sometimes extremely clean, sometimes hit with a pungent smell</li>
                    <li>Weird layout that makes the space feel larger than expected</li>
                    <li>Occasionally has water all over the floor. The temperature is still boiling</li>
                    <li>Not exactly crowded, but somehow there are always people around</li>
                    <li>Never seen any primary kids there - only secondary and high school students</li>
                </ul>
        
                <p>Cons:</p>
                <ul class="cons-list">
                    <li>Two stalls, as usual</li>
                    <li>Often lacks toilet paper</li>
                    <li>The unit is closed during evening recess</li>

        <p>The toilet inside the primary library is an unpredictable experience - you never quite know what you’re walking into. Some days it’s spotless; other days a sudden pungent smell greets you at the door. The unusual layout makes it feel more spacious than most campus bathrooms, and with its usual two stalls, it’s functional enough. There’s often water scattered across the floor, and while it isn’t crowded, there always seem to be people passing through. Interestingly, despite being in the primary library, it’s mostly used by secondary and high school students. The biggest drawbacks are the frequent lack of toilet paper and the fact that the unit closes during evening recess, which can be inconvenient. Overall: chaotic but usable.</p>

                    <li>Was a terrible toilet last year, but had a real “glow up” this year</li>

        <p>The Unit 2.4 toilet has become part of my daily routine, and it’s had quite a transformation since last year. What used to be just a decent washroom has genuinely glowed up, especially with its surprisingly pleasant morning smell and the cool temperature that makes it way more comfortable than most campus toilets. The toilet paper supply is always overflowing, and I still miss the period pad box they had back in 2023—it deserves a comeback. However, it’s not perfect: the first stall occasionally jams and refuses to flush, and the place can get unexpectedly crowded because not everyone who goes there actually intends to use the toilet. Because of that, it’s not a great spot for pooping, but for morning use, it’s still one of the better options around.</p>

                    <li>Ideal place for pooping</li>

        <p>The toilet under the main staircase is one of the strangest restroom experiences on campus. Hidden behind a nearly abandoned hallway, it’s weirdly perfect for pooping thanks to its isolation, though that same isolation also makes it extremely creepy when you’re alone. The place is hot and humid, but it’s consistently stocked and checked, which is more than you can say for other toilets. Expect to encounter parents during busy hours, even though there’s a sign telling them not to be there. The Wi-Fi is unusually strong, but the atmosphere is unsettling: the door has a habit of opening by itself, the stalls have lower barriers, and you can hear footsteps and running right outside. It’s the kind of restroom used by people who are either desperate or dealing with catastrophic bowel situations — and honestly, it fits the energy.</p>
